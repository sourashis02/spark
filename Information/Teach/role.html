            <p>The saying goes, having kids will not only be the most challenging thing you’ll do in life, but also the most rewarding. As a parent, you take on a tremendous responsibility for your child’s well-being. Everything you do and say helps to shape or hinder your child’s development and personality. The job becomes even more challenging when you have a child with special needs.

                A parent’s role is ever-changing where every day is a new day with a new set of challenges, 
                and a new set of praises as well. You have to give love, support, and guidance to your loved o
                nes through the easy and tough situations throughout their lives. But parents are amaz
                ing and with a little help, you can do it and be an excellent parent for your child.</p>
            
                          <div class="infobox">
                            <h2>Learn More about Your Child’s Needs </h2>
                            <p>Knowing the specific needs your child makes taking care of them a little easier. The more you know about their needs, the better you can prepare to help your child. Learning about various autism and disability needs will also broaden your perspective.  

                                If you don’t learn, you will focus more on what your child cannot do. You will constantly compare your child with another child. It’s not only unfair but a
                                lso counterproductive and will hinder your child’s development.</p>

                          <h2>Be Positive</h2>
                         <p>Just because your child has a specific way of doing things, it doesn’t make him/her unfit. They do certain things differently and that’s absolutely okay! Don’t get upset and look down on your child. Embrace the new normal, stay positive and fair.
                            It wouldn’t hurt to adjust the expectations you have set. Having a special need doesn’t mean being unsuccessful in life. You also need to be mentally and emotionally strong for the sake of your child.</p>

                         <p>In most cases, it’s the teachers who give a referral for a child’s evaluation of any special needs. If you notice or feel your child needs an assessment, It’s best to seek out a professional. The specifics around your child’s special needs will be revealed in the evaluation. It will help you 
                             understand your child’s differences so you can plan for his/her future better.</p>

                           <h2>Enroll in Special Needs Education</h2>
                            <p>As a parent, you want to give your child the best education possible. So, make it a priority to enroll him/her into a special needs class. That way the teachers can prepare your child for an Individual Education Program (IPE). 
                                 The IPE is specially designed to help children with specific needs.</p>

                            <h2>Parents Are the Best Advocates for Their Child</h2>
                            <p>There is no one as interested in and motivated to see a child succeed and thrive than her own parents, and this alone places the parent in a crucial role on the IEP team.

                                How can you advocate for your child?</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Learn as much as you can about their disability.</li>
                                    <li>Observe your child's learning styles. Despite the specialized tests which attempt to discern how children learn best,
                                         parents are in the best position to watch this in action every single day.</li>
                                    <li>Keep careful records of your child's education, including any testing and any IEP reports. Find a way to file these 
                                        carefully so that you have them on hand readily if needed.</li>	
                                    <li>Correspond with teachers and other professionals in writing whenever possible, and hang on to these communications. Hopefully, you will not need to refer back to any of these records,
                                         but if the need arises, you will have them in black and white.</li>
                                    </ul>

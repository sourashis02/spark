            <p>A student struggling to understand what he reads often misinterprets assignments and fails to grasp concepts. This is very
                 frustrating for a student who is otherwise capable of interpreting the information</p>

                            <h2>Basic strategies and techniques </h2>
                            <p>When we read, our overall goal is to monitor our understanding and make sure that we are getting meaning from the printed page. This comprehension monitoring is a process that is critical for students to develop, and it is one which students often overlook. Encouraging your student to monitor understanding and use strategies 
                                while reading is a critical gift that will provide benefits throughout life.</p>

                          <h2>Multisensory strategies</h2>
                         <p>Students derive more benefit from activities in which they actively participate. Active learning enhances efficiency and the child understands and grasps concepts with greater depth.

                            Multisensory techniques increase active awareness. Students, especially those with learning challenges, benefit from being able to pull in memory hooks (mnemonics) along with multisensory techniques.
                            
                            As former IDA president Dr. Marcia Henry said, "Multisensory instruction is the linkage of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic-tactile modalities. Students simultaneously link the visual symbol (what they see) with its corresponding sound (what they hear) and kinesthetic-tactile input (what they feel) as they write a letter accurately and say the corresponding sound(s)."</p>

                           <h2>Visually organizing information</h2>
    
                         <p>Many students who struggle with reading and writing, and even students who avoid such tasks for other reasons, tend to be visual in how they process information. Thus, utilizing those visual skills can be a great asset while reading to comprehend.


                            Visualization
                            Visualization is a process where the students create a visual picture mentally to correspond to the ideas they are listening to or reading. Visualization is a powerful tool that helps many students comprehend a passage. It increases active reading and helps the information "stick."
                            
                            To encourage visualization, have your student close her eyes and imagine a common object. Then have your child verbally describe or draw what she imagined.
                            
                            Once she understands the process, you may move to the next step. You read a sentence and cue her to develop visual images by asking detailed questions. For example, possible questions for the sentence, "The girl scurried down the street" include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    What does the street look like?
                                </li>
                                <li>How do you think the girl is going down the street?</li>
                                <li>What size is the girl?</li>
                                <li>What is she wearing?</li>
                                <li>What you think the girl is thinking or feeling as she is running?</li>
                                <li>Is it daytime or night? What in your picture in your head led you to that conclusion?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Reinforce that there are no right or wrong answers and each person creates a different visual picture. The important aspect is to be able to explain why you imagined your image (if the girl is small, for example). What cues did you use?

                                "Enhancing a student's use of the mind's eye enhances comprehension. Strategies are useful tool to accomplish this."
                                
                                Another way to represent information visually is to have your child draw a picture that shows what he read. Many children may find that representing words and/or stories in picture form creates a visual image that clarifies the meaning and the connection between people or events in what they read.</p>

                            <p>As a parent, you want to give your child the best education possible. So, make it a priority to enroll him/her into a special needs class. That way the teachers can prepare your child for an Individual Education Program (IPE). 
                                 The IPE is specially designed to help children with specific needs.</p>

                           <p>These tips for your reading comprehension toolbox are just a few of many that are available. Hopefully, they will be useful to you and your student with your

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Remember to use chunking: go slowly and apply or use only one part at a time.</li>
                                    <li>Use multisensory strategies.</li>
                                    <li>Teach your child a strategy one step at a time.</li>
                                    <li>And above all, make it an enjoyable activity!</li>
